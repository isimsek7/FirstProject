I've used, endless loops which end if certain conditions happen, void methods, try-catch blocks, and exception handlers.
Program simply asks the user to choose which program to trigger, then innitiates it, after the program has done it's job
another statement asks whetever the user wants to continue and choose another program, then loops back to start or quits according to user input.
